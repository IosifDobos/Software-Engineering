## Joe Restaurant Software Engineering Assignment 2

	The restaurant software application is developed to support day-to-day operations for a 
    restaurant by improving the process of making reservtion and allocation tables to customers 
    and other features.
    In the Restaurant case study, customers can make a reservation to the restaurant and also
    can walk-in into the restaurant. In order to make areservation customers must provide some
    information like the name to be added to the reservation system and a phone number to be 
    contacted. Before making a reservation to a tables from the restaurant, table must be 
    available in order to make the reservation possible. Also, we need to check customers who 
    walks-in to in order to avoid overlaping a booking at a same table. OCL constraints and 
    invariants are used to avoid bugs and errors for the software application.

	Design Patterns 
 
	My restaurant model is assumed to be implemented as a desktop application: with single 
    user and normal input and output 7 devices like mouse, keyboard, screen etc. In this model 
    there is the Application Layer and Presentation layer. 
    The Presentation layer it is used to present data to the application layer in an accurate, 
    well-defined and standardized format, also is checking the application layer for updates. 
    The presentation layer mainly translates data between the application layer and the network 
    format. The Application layer is the one that directly interacts with the user.
