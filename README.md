## Joe Restaurant Software Engineering Assignment 2

	The restaurant software application is developed to support day-to-day operations for a restaurant by improving 
	the process of making reservtion and allocation tables to customers and other features.
	In the Restaurant case study, customers can make reservation to the restaurant for dinner. In order to do the 
	reservation customers must provide some information like the name to make the reservation for and a phone number to be 
	contacted. Before making a reservation tables from the restaurant needs to be available to make the reservation possible. 
	Also, we need to check customers who walks to make reservation for them as well in order to avoid customers to have dinner 
	at the same table and time. OCL constraints and invariants are used to avoid bugs and errors.

	Design Patterns 
 
	My restaurant model is assumed to be implemented as a desktop application: with single user and normal input and output 7
	devices like mouse, keyboard, screen etc. In this model there is the Application Layer and Presentation layer. 
	The Presentation layer it is used to present data to the application layer in an accurate, well-defined and standardized 
	format, also is checking the application layer for updates. The presentation layer mainly translates data between the 
	application layer and the network format. The Application layer is the one that directly interacts with the user.
